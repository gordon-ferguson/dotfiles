# Dotfiles

Slowly adding dotfiles at my leisure after pruning through them
to make sure no compromising personal information is leaked.

Will update with keybinds and more descriptive commentary but for now
simply assume everything is generally built around vim keybindings or a very similar adaptation.

If you're looking for my neovim configuration, I have made that into
it's own repository and is probably my most essential program. 


Programs to install:
neovim
ripgrep
ranger
fzf
zoxide
tmux
firefox
btop
zathura
